# My knowledge of language models

## Quick Overview
Here I will document a bunch of my knowledge of language models so that it can be referenced in one central location. I will attempt to maintain and update this, please open an issue if there's anything specific you want added!

I'll break it up into sections to keep stuff organized.

1. [Quantization](./quantization/quantization.md)
       - [Precision and Memory Usage](./quantization/quantization.md#precision-and-memory-usage)
       - [Basic Quantization Concepts](./quantization/quantization.md#basic-quantization-concepts)
       - [GGUF Quantization Techniques](./quantization/quantization.md#gguf-quantization-techniques)
       - [Imatrix](./quantization/quantization.md#imatrix-enhancement)
2. [Tokenizers](./tokenizer/tokenizers.md)
       - [What is a token?](./tokenizer/tokenizers.md#what-is-a-token)
       - [Special tokens](./tokenizer/tokenizers.md#special-tokens)
       - [Chat templates](./tokenizer/tokenizers.md#chat-templates)

## What's next

- Very basic sampler settings (there are much better people than myself for these)
- Other formats (exl2, AWQ, GPTQ, etc)
- Base vs instruct tuning
- More?
